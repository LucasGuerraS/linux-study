# Lucas Guerra Unix Study

This repository is designed to be the place where I upload all my Unix-related studies. Here you will find materials, notes, and code examples covering topics such as:

- Bash scripting
- File permissions
- Unix commands and utilities
- Shell customization
- Process management
- And other related Unix concepts

## Documentation

In addition to this repository, I've created a comprehensive Notion page to document and organize my Unix studies with detailed notes, examples, and learning progress.
